summary: |
  Shell charm housing a library to facilitate the development and
  testing of FINOS Legend charmed Operators.

description: |
  This charm offers two libraries, `charms.finos_legend_libs.v0.legend_operator_base`,
  and `charms.finos_legend_libs.v0.legend_operator_testing`.
  The `legend_operator_base` library allows quick modeling of FINOS Legend services
  which feature a one-preconfigured-container workload.
  The `legend_operator_testing` library offers a quick and easy framework to plug
  actual charm classes into for testing.
